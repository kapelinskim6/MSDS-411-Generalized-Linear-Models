# Generlaized_Linear_Models

This course extends linear “OLS” regression by introducing the concept of Generalized Linear Model “GLM” regression. 
The course reviews traditional linear regression and then continues with logistic regression, poisson regression, and survival analysis. 
The course is heavily weighted towards practical application with large data sets containing missing values and outliers. 
It addresses issues of data preparation, model development, model validation, and model deployment.
